## **About me**

Hi! This is Harshitha Bagepalli Chandrashekar, a master's student studying  **Precision Medicine: Genomics and Analytics** at the University of Leeds. I have a triple major undergraduate degree in **Chemistry, Microbiology and Biotechnology**. Around the end of the first year, I saw a few online courses on bacterial genomics from the Wellcome connecting sciences and conferences. I took them out of sheer curiosity, with absolutely no interest or background in computer science. However, the things that I learned from those courses made me want to learn genomics and make it my career. All I knew about programming, which is so essential for genomics/bioinformatics was that it exists and a very little HTML that I was forced to learn in school and hated.  So, I slowly started picking up basics, a little bit of Python and R, a couple of internships and a Bioinformatics module in the 3rd year. This only made me love it more and hence I decided to go to Leeds for my master's in Genomics and Analytics. 

I think taking up my master's was the real start of my genomics journey. I was no longer sat wearing white coats with a microscope or a pipette but instead sat next to maths dude and took statistics. I took modules like High throughput technologies, Statistical learning (which was basically ML but with a more statistical lens) and Analytical skills modules, all of which taught me about different NGS technologies out there and how to analyse the data and make sense of it. There was also a module on Big data: common and rare disorders that made us use WGS data to identify the cause of a genetic disease in a family and develop precision diagnosis and therapy options, isn't that just fascinating??!? I also took cancer biology and genetic epidemiology modules. As for my final project, I was given a catalogue of projects happening and had to select 3 based on our interests. I chose the ones that had the most biology (the science kid in me just wanted that) and ended up at the most fabulous Aspden lab, under Dr Julie Aspden. I was introduced to Ribosome profiling and analysis of the data generated from it. Using this, I tried to understand the novel translational events in lncRNA during neuronal differentiation. This undoubtedly was the highlight of my master's, as I picked up skills in BAsh scripting, HPC usage and navigating, usage of Linux and of course, sharpened my R programming. 

As I am approaching my graduation and setting foot into the real world of science, I am aiming to showcase my projects and skills here, hopefully to catch a recruiter's eye. And also, I just love biology and bioinformatics.
